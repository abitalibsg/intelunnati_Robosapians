# Robosapians_Saintgits College Of Engineering_Accident Locations On Indian Roads
Final Report Submission for Intel Unnati Industrial Training
### Description: 
India ranks first in the world for the number of accidents and lives lost on the roads.The country has 1% of the vehicles in the world.Ministry of road transport uses concept of Blackspot to mark these locations to improve road safety on national highways in the country.Here we have collected data of the state kerala.
### Data mapping 
* Selected a the state Kerala for analysis.
* Latitude and longitude of the accident locations are found and latitude and longitude of near by hospitals are found.
* Using QGIS software ,these locations are plotted on the map of the area.
* Heatmap of the accidents are also created.

### Data processing and visualization
According to these data a visualization graph is made according to severity of accidents ,accidents in each state etc
  
### Data processing and machine learning
Latitudinal and longitudinal data are used for machine learning for clustering the points based on severity,fatality etc.Using Kmeans clustering these data are clustered

### Future outcome
Using these data a software can be developed for warning the drivers of the blackspot location by an alarm system.
